## üöÄ Production Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Git
- A Supabase account and project
- PostgreSQL knowledge for database management
- Domain name (for production deployment)
- SSL certificate (recommended for HIPAA compliance)

### 1. Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/medcare-emr.git
   cd medcare-emr
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Database Configuration

1. **Set up Supabase tables and schemas**
   Navigate to your Supabase project and run the SQL scripts located in:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/
   ```
   Execute these in the order of their prefixed dates.

2. **Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies**
   Apply the security policies from:
   ```
   src/utils/fhir/setupPolicies.sql
   ```

3. **Deploy Edge Functions**
   ```sh
   cd supabase
   npx supabase functions deploy rxnorm-sync
   npx supabase functions deploy rxnorm-anvisa-map
   npx supabase functions deploy rxnorm-portuguese-mapping
   ```

### 3. Application Build

1. **Create a production build**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates optimized files in the `dist` directory.

2. **Test the production build locally**
   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```
   
### 4. Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Traditional Web Hosting

1. **Upload to a web server**
   Transfer the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server's public directory.

2. **Configure server for SPA routing**
   For Apache, create a `.htaccess` file in the root directory:
   ```
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteBase /
     RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
     RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   </IfModule>
   ```
   
   For Nginx, update your server configuration:
   ```
   location / {
     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
   }
   ```

#### Option 2: Cloud Platform Deployment

1. **Deploy to Netlify**
   ```sh
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify login
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```sh
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Deploy to AWS Amplify**
   ```sh
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   amplify configure
   amplify init
   amplify add hosting
   amplify publish
   ```

### 5. Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Configure domain and SSL**
   Set up your custom domain and SSL certificate through your hosting provider.

2. **Set up monitoring**
   Implement application monitoring using services like Sentry, LogRocket, or AWS CloudWatch.

3. **Setup backup procedures**
   Configure regular database backups from your Supabase project.

4. **HIPAA Compliance Verification**
   - Ensure all PHI data is encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Verify access controls and authentication mechanisms
   - Test audit logging functionality
   - Review and document compliance with HIPAA Technical Safeguards

### 6. Scaling Considerations

1. **Database Performance**
   - Monitor query performance
   - Implement database indexing for frequently accessed tables
   - Consider read replicas for high-traffic deployments

2. **Application Performance**
   - Implement CDN for static assets
   - Consider server-side rendering for improved initial load times
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting
