# Orphaned Pages Reintegration Project

## Problem Statement

The OmniCare EMR system has 45 potentially orphaned pages that are fully implemented but not properly referenced in the application's routing configuration, making them inaccessible through normal navigation paths.

## Solution

This project provides a systematic approach to analyze and reintegrate these orphaned pages into the application. We've started with a pilot of 3 high-priority pages and provided a framework for addressing the remaining pages.

## Project Files

### Analysis Documents

- [**Orphaned-Pages-Analysis-Plan.md**](./Orphaned-Pages-Analysis-Plan.md) - Comprehensive plan for analyzing and reintegrating orphaned pages
- [**orphaned-pages-analysis.json**](./orphaned-pages-analysis.json) - Detailed analysis of all orphaned pages with categorization and dependencies
- [**Orphaned-Pages-Pilot-Analysis-Summary.md**](./Orphaned-Pages-Pilot-Analysis-Summary.md) - Summary of the analysis of the three pilot pages

### Implementation Documents

- [**Orphaned-Pages-Implementation-Plan.md**](./Orphaned-Pages-Implementation-Plan.md) - Detailed plan for implementing the changes needed to reintegrate the pilot pages
- [**reintegrate-orphaned-pages.js**](./reintegrate-orphaned-pages.js) - Script to automate the implementation of the changes
- [**Orphaned-Pages-Project-Summary.md**](./Orphaned-Pages-Project-Summary.md) - Overall summary of the project and instructions for implementation

## Pilot Pages

The following three pages were selected for the pilot implementation:

1. **CriticalResults** - Displays and manages critical test results that require immediate attention
2. **FluidBalance** - Tracks patient fluid intake and output
3. **PatientProfile** - Displays and allows editing of patient profile information

## Implementation Instructions

1. Review the analysis documents to understand the issue and the proposed solution
2. Run the implementation script to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   node reintegrate-orphaned-pages.js
   ```
3. Test the changes to ensure everything works as expected
4. Apply the same approach to the remaining orphaned pages

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are encountered, use the backup files created by the script to restore the original state:
```bash
cp src/routes/RouteConfig.ts.bak src/routes/RouteConfig.ts
cp src/config/sidebarConfig.ts.bak src/config/sidebarConfig.ts
cp src/constants/permissions.ts.bak src/constants/permissions.ts
cp src/i18n/translations.ts.bak src/i18n/translations.ts
```

## Next Steps

After successfully reintegrating the three pilot pages:

1. Evaluate the success of the pilot implementation
2. Apply the same approach to the remaining orphaned pages
3. Update the documentation to include information about the reintegrated pages
4. Consider implementing automated tests to prevent future orphaned pages
