# Archived Orphaned Pages Files

This directory contains archived files related to the orphaned pages management system that have been consolidated into a unified system.

## Purpose

These files were part of the original approach to managing orphaned pages in the OmniCare EMR system. They have been archived as part of a consolidation effort to create a more streamlined and maintainable system.

## Consolidated System

The new unified orphaned pages management system consists of:

- **Main Script**: `orphaned-pages-manager.js` in the project root
- **Supporting Modules**: Located in `src/tools/orphaned-pages/`
- **Documentation**: `Orphaned-Pages-Management.md` in the project root
